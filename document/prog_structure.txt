dt_start
initialize programs, call source() to source each of the needed source files
initialize WindR API and print the connection status with Wind server

dt_run
run the process as documented in methodology section in 'introduction.txt'



calc_corr_delta_matrix.R
#function: calc the correlation-(delta-t) matrix
#w_wsd_data: data with Wind API data format
#max_dt: maximum lag time to be claculated
#(delta_t needs to be limited to a practical range)
#(if the delta_t to achieve the highest correlation is too long, it becomes meaningless)

calculate a 3-D matrix with three axis. 
Axis one: a vector of industry index
Axis two: a vector of industry index (exactly same as axis one)
Axis three: delta-t (the time shifted between two time series)

A point in the matrix: x = A$'Finance'$'Energy'[66] represent: 
the correlation between two time series(Finance index close price, and Energy index close price), when the two time series are shifted by 66 days.
